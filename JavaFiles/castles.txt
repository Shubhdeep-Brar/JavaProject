In this file there are going to be 3 sample inputs. Feel free to add more sample
inputs yourself. The format of the sample inputs would be like:
[2,6,6,6,3]
[6,1,4]
[6]
In this file, each line shows one sample input. Your program should be able to read the
file and all the lines and run the project for the sample input and generate the results in
console.
oTo evaluate your program the instructor will add another 10 sample inputs to this file
when evaluating your project. For each failed test, 5% will be deducted from the total
mark for that question.
